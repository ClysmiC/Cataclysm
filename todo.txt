=====================
==== TOP OF MIND ====
=====================

[~] Figure out the story for reflecting RenderComponent
    [X] Reflect mesh name in UI
    [X] Can set the component visible/invisible
    [X] Can remove the render component(s) for a mesh for an entity
        [ ] Remove/unload(?) it from resource manager if nothing else uses it (ref count?)
    [X] Add render component(s) for a mesh for an entity
        [X] Devise a way to list all known obj files and let user select one
           [X] Text box to filter!
        [X] Add it to resource manager if it isn't already
        [X] Load it async and maybe spin a wheel for better "loading" feedback?

[X] Change component ComponentGroup parameters to pointers (i.e., in aabbFromRenderComponents)
[X] Add quickhull implementation
    [X] Render the result using DebugDraw drawLine
    [X] Change ColliderComponent to PrimitiveColliderComponent and add ConvexHullColliderComponent

[X] Investigate airboat mesh fishiness... should be one submesh per usemtl

[X] Port GJK/EPA code
[X] Collision + resolution when walking

[X] Select entity in editor based on primitive collider + convex hull collider + render aabb
[X] Test GJK against convex hull colliders
[X] Add/inspect convex hull collider in editor
[X] Controller input
[ ] Create 3rd person entity (player)
   [~] Attach camera offset from it
   [X] Render a mesh
   [~] Move and resolve collisions
   [ ] Walljump?
[ ] Design better level w/ some cool textures

==== MID PRIOIRTY ====
======================


======================
==== LOW PRIORITY ====
======================


===============
==== MAYBE ====
===============

[ ] Some way to ensure that we are iterating over every component type that can be in an entity (needed for UI, serialization, deleting an entity, etc.)
[ ] Consider making a global Game* instead of passing the Game* around everywhere
[ ] Split between engine and game-specific stuff (like portal)
[ ] Find a better spot to put the getEntity stuff... I'd rather not have every file require to include "Game.h"


====================
==== KNOWN BUGS ====
====================

[ ] Can sometimes see through UV seams
[ ] Incorrect lighting when mesh is non-uniformly scaled. Probably not properly handling normals?
