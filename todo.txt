[X] Make TransformComponent mandatory (so many things depend on it)
[ ] Delete entity functionality (backend, and UI)
[ ] Add component functionality (in UI)
[ ] Add entity functionality (in UI)
[ ] Stress test adding/deleting several components, creating many buckets in the bucket array, etc.

[ ] Reflect render component.... group them together based on mesh file somehow?
[ ] Add point light back in
[ ] Draw sticker to show where point light, camera, and directional light are

REORGANIZE DIRECTORY
  - Change Types.h to als_types
  - Make subdir for als_ files... consider renaming them too
  - Make subdir for components
  - Make subdir for systems (i.e., behaviors that use components)
  - Split between engine and game-specific stuff (like portal)
  - Clean up #includes and aggressively forward-declare to lower compile times


- Some way to ensure that we are iterating over every component type that can be in an entity (needed for UI, serialization, deleting an entity, etc.)
