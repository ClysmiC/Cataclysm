ARRAY_BUCKET data structure for components

TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF COMPONENTS BETWEEN SCENES
  - This invalidates pointers... can we use a handle somehow?
  - The pointers should stay valid until the end of frame (i.e., actual transition happens at known time at end of frame)
  - Maybe overload assigning of the pointers to discourage saving them?

REORGANIZE DIRECTORY
  - Change Types.h to als_types
  - Make subdir for als_ files... consider renaming them too
  - Make subdir for components
  - Make subdir for systems (i.e., behaviors that use components)
  - Split between engine and game-specific stuff (like portal)
  - Clean up #includes and aggressively forward-declare to lower compile times
