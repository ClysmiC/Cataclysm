RESOURCE MANAGER
- canonical mesh
- canonical material
- canonical shader
- canonical texture

ENTITY
- Just an ID

COMPONENTS
- Transform
  - canonical position
  - canonical orientation
  - canonical scale

- Physics
  - semi-canonical transform (physics manager will copy changes into the canonical one)
  - canonical velocity
  - canonical collider
    - tagged-union of collider types
	  - sphere
	  - capsule
	  - cylinder
	  - rect3
  
- Input handler
   |-> Game-code defined function
       ptr to handleInput(input, Entity*)
	   Entity will be able to grab whatever components it wants and update them accordingly
	   Only 1 or 2 entities will realistically handle input (definitely <10) so it's okay to chase pointers
	   
- RenderComponent
  - nc-mesh
  - nc-material
  - nc-shader
  - nc-transform


ECS
map entity id -> component (one map per component type)
handle copying to non-canonical copies and then updating them back to the canonical copy
